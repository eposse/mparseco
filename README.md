# mperseco

mperseco is a minimalist monadic parser combinator library. It is essentially an implementation of the parsing combinators from Philip Wadler's seminal paper "[Monads for functional programming](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-02880-3_8)". It can be seen as a minimal subset of Haskell's well known library "[parsec](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec)".
